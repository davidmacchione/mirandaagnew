				<h3>Project Bio</h3>
				<h4>A new collaborative project between Katie Webster (saxophone) and Miranda Agnew (trumpet), LoomTone blurs the lines between individual and collective ideation, exploring a shared compositional language.<br>Inspired by reflections on the work and stories of textile artists, Miranda and Katie’s compositions frame the improvisational voices of the ensemble, consisting of themselves alongside Ariel Vera (voice), Rocío Sánchez (cello), David Macchione (bass), and Alex Yoo (drums).
				</h4> 
				<h4>
				With roots in jazz and experimental music, LoomTone features whimsical counterpoint, lyrical melodies, and varied improvisational frameworks.<br>The set of compositions, which are heavily influenced by personal studies of community-oriented textile artists, were largely composed over the course of a MacDowell residency in February-March 2025.
