				<h4>Teeter is a jazz quartet featuring Miranda Agnew (trumpet), Naomi Nakanishi (piano), David Macchione (bass), and Alex Yoo (drums).<br>Since Summer 2024, the ensemble has been workshopping Miranda’s compositions, which explore topics ranging from the emotions surrounding her move to New York City to her love of Sci-Fi/Fantasy books. Each piece features intricate counterpoint, shifting rhythmic foundations, and rich harmonic structures.<br>Members of teeter approach the music with strong creative momentum, creating no shortage of exciting moments and a sense of freedom.</h4>

				<h4>Teeter made their debut in August 2024 at a well attended show at All Street Gallery on the Lower East Side.<br>Individually, members of Teeter have played at Roulette (NYC), the Jazz Gallery (NYC), Birdland (NYC), Jamboree (Barcelona) and Bimhuis (Amsterdam).
